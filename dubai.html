      Dubai, is the most populous city in the
      United Arab Emirates (UAE) and the capital of the Emirate of Dubai, the
      most populated of the country's seven emirates. Established in
      the 18th century as a small fishing village, Dubai grew into a regional
      trading hub in the early 20th century and grew rapidly in the late 20th
      and early 21st centuries with a focus on tourism and luxury. It has
      the second-most five-star hotels in the world and boasts the tallest
      building in the world, the Burj Khalifa, which is 828 metres 
      tall. In the eastern Arabian Peninsula, on the coast of the Persian
      Gulf, it is a major global transport hub for passengers and cargo.
      Oil revenue helped accelerate the development of the city, which was
      already a major mercantile hub. Dubai has been a centre for regional and
      international trade since the early 20th century, and its economy relies
      on revenues from trade, tourism, aviation, real estate, and financial
      services. Oil production contributed less than 1 percent
      of the emirate's GDP in 2018. The city has a population of around 3.60
      million (as of 2022).
