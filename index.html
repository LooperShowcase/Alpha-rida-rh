<p>Travel is the movement of people between distant geographical locations. Travel can be done by foot, bicycle,<br>
  automobile, train, boat, bus, airplane, ship or other means, with or without luggage, and can be one way or round <br>
  trip. Travel can also include relatively short stays between successive movements, as in the case of tourism. <br>
